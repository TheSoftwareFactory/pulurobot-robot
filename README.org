* Robot Console Client

** Current Functionality

    =quit=        Terminates the program

    =help=        Prints the help message containing available commands

    =listen=      Streams information broadcasted by the robot (Still needs work).
                  Press [Enter] to stop the stream.

    =free=        Will unlock the wheels of the robot, to be able to freely move it around
    =stop=        Will tell the robot to stop whatever it is currently doing

    =save [a|b]=  Saves robots current coordinates as location A or B

    =goto [a|b]=  Will try to route to location A or B respectively


** Todo

 - Improve =listen= with more commands, e.g. the =140= (Robot state) code.
 - Code-reorganizing: Detach functionality from the command-line UI, such
   that the functionality can be reused.
