* Robot Console Client

** Current Functionality

    =quit=        Terminates the program

    =help=        Prints the help message containing available commands

    =listen=      Prints information broadcasted by the robot (only partially working)

    =save {a|b}=  Saves robots current coordinates as location A or B

    =goto {a|b}=  Will try to route to location A or B respectively


** Todo

 - Improve listener with more commands, e.g. the =140= (Robot state) code.
